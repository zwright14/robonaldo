This consists of all the code used in the making of the robonaldo robot soccer team.

The necessary code to operate the robot soccer team is broken down into four folders. Two of which are for the attacker transmitter and receiver, and the other are for the defender transmitter and receiver. An RF 315 transmitter/receiver pair was used on the defender robot, while an RF 434 MHz transmitter/receiver were used on the attacker robot.

The other folders were used for testing purposes.
